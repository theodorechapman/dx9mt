# WORKFLOW

- The docs/ folder contains three markdowns. Always read these before doing anything else
    - architecture.md: A detailed breakdown of the structure of the project and its design patterns. Use this as a reference to navigate around the repo
    - insights.md: Every time you make a mistake or learn something new that would be hard to infer again, leave it here. Aggressively cut down the rate of mistakes
    - roadmap.md: The past, present, and future state of the project as defined in specialized sessions and as features are completed and validated.
